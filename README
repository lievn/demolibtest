SceneBuilder Demonstration Library
==================================
Demolib shows you how to create a new SceneBuilder library, including optional self libraries.

You will have to change build.properties to point to your SceneBuilder libraries folder.
This folder should contain:

 * equinox.jar
 * processing-core.jar
 * nodebox-core.jar
